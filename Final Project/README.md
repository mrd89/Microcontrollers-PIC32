### Final Project: Capacitive Sensing Robot Arm

By: Matthew Daniel & Ximeng Zhang

Date: 2019-Nov


### Introduction
We built a 2 DOF robot arm with a capacitive sensor on the end effector to make the system human-safe. When a person gets very close to the robot arm, the program will reduce speed or stop altogether depending on the distance from the sensor. 

### Overall Design
We built a simple website on this project. Please see a detailed explanation here: http://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/FinalProjects/f2019/xz737_mrd89/xz737_mrd89/xz737_mrd89/index.html
